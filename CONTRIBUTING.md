Contributing Guidelines
=============

## Code Style Guide

* Use tab characters for spacing
* No trailing whitespace and also blank lines should have no whitespace
* Make use of strict equals === unless type coercion is intended
* Follow conventions already established in project's source code
* Validate changes with eslint and build/test the project to make sure you didn't break anything


In order to simplify the usage of common project settings across systems, editors and IDEs we are using EditorConfig. Please refer to [http://editorconfig.org/](http://editorconfig.org/) for more info and check the [settings](.editorconfig).
